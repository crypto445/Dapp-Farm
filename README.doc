FarmToken, is a yield farming dapp that allows you to generate Dapp Tokens through DAI staking. Admin(Owner), can run issue-token.js (inside scripts folder), to distribute tokens to stakers. Chainlink is integrated for future use. There are two tokens contracts (DaiTokensol and DappToken.sol) and the farm contract (TokenFarm.) To run this project locally, run npm install, open ganache to correct port, then npm start.
